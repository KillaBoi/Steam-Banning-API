# Steam-Publisher-API-Banning
This repository uses the Steamworks "ICheatReportingService Interface" to assist you in banning a user from your game.

## Getting your Steamworks API Key
1) Login to your account on the [Steam Partner Page](https://partner.steamgames.com/)
2) Click on "Users & Permissions" and select "Manage Groups"
3) Click on "Everyone"
4) On the right side, there will be a "Create WebAPI Key" button, press it and you'll get it. Keep it safe and do not share it with anyone.

**NOTE: Your "Everyone" group must have the application added to the group itself, if it is not then only the owner of the original appid can create a new group and add the application to it.**
